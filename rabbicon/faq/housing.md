### Should I keep my rabbit in a cage or hutch?

No. It is common to keep a rabbit outside in a hutch, but if your rabbit is a pet, why would you do that? Rabbits need space to run around, jump, and play. Think of a rabbit like a cat. Wouldn't it seem weird to keep a cat outside in a cage? Sitting in a hutch your whole life is not fun.

### How can I keep my rabbit inside?

The same way people keep a cat inside. They just put them on the ground and let them go about their day. The only thing you must do is make sure there are no electrial cords on the ground. It's easier than you think to keep them off the ground, or cover them in a protective covering.

Rabbits like to chew, some more than others. My rabbit really doesn't chew on furniture at all, so the chewing issue may not be as big of a problem as you might think.

### Will rabbits use a litter box?
