### Should I keep my rabbit in a cage or hutch?

No. It is common to keep a rabbit outside in a hutch, but if your rabbit is a pet, why would you do that? Rabbits need space to run around, jump, and play. Think of a rabbit like a cat. Wouldn't it seem weird to keep a cat outside in a cage? Sitting in a hutch your whole life is not fun.

### How can I keep my rabbit inside?

The same way people keep a cat inside. Just put them on the ground and let them go about their day. The only thing you **must** do is make sure there are no electrial cords on the ground, or make sure they are covered. It's easier than you think to keep them off the ground, or keep them in a protective covering. For protective sleeves, there are [many options](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Electronics-Cable-Sleeves/zgbs/electronics/6577542011) to choose from.

Rabbits like to chew, some more than others. My rabbit really doesn't chew on furniture at all, so the chewing issue may not be as big of a problem as you might think.

### Will rabbits use a litter box?

Yes, they will! Rabbits poop where they eat, so it's very easy to train them to use a litter box. Just keep their food and water in the litter box. When they pee outside of it, wipe it up with a paper towel and put it in the litter box, as well as any stray poops. Soon, they will associate the litter box with the bathroom.

Rabbits will pee to mark their territory, so make sure to spray the area to remove the scent. When rabbits mature, they will start marking their territory more frequently. This indicates that it is time to get them spayed or neutered. Afterwards, they should stop marking their territory.

One more thing. Rabbits will never *completely* use the litter box to poop. You'll always have to clean up stray poops. But you will find that the vast majority of poops will be in the litter box, and in my rabbits case she almost never pees outside of her litter box. It happens on occasion, but is quite rare.

### What kind of litter should I use?

First, don't use cat litter! It clumps and they may accidentally eat it. It also makes a big mess and gets stuck all over their fur. I use this [pine pellet bedding](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/tractor-supply-pine-pellet-stall-bedding-40-lb) to absorb pee, and then put timothy hay on top (the same kind they eat).

Clean the litter box by dumping it out and replacing the bedding and hay at least once a week. If you don't change the litter box frequently enough, you will find that your rabbit starts using the bathroom outside of it. They really like to stay clean.

### Do rabbits smell bad?

No. Rabbits keep themselves very clean. Their poops are generally small, hard, round, and don't smell. Their pee also doesn't have much of an odor, if at all.
