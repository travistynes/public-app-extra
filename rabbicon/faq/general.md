## Rabbicon FAQ

### About

This FAQ is intended to provide useful tips and advice from personal experience having a rabbit as a pet. This information is applied to rabbits *in general*. This means it will not always be 100% true for every single rabbit. Keep this in mind.

### Do rabbits bite?

No. That is the simple, general answer. Rabbits have teeth, so they *can* bite, and someone probably has been bitten by a rabbit at some point in time. But this is not something you should worry about or be afraid of. The reason rabbits don't bite is simple: Rabbits are prey animals. They don't use their teeth for defense, and they don't attack when they are frightened. They run away.

Kids pick up rabbits in pet stores all the time. The rabbits don't generally care, and rabbits don't really like to be picked up. I have held an angry rabbit against its will to give it medicine that it *really* didn't want to take. But it never tried to bite.

### Do rabbits like to be picked up?

No. Some rabbits may put up with it, but even they would rather not be picked up. Most rabbits, even if they really like you, will kick and struggle to be put down. A rabbit's own mother doesn't pick it up. In nature, if a rabbit is being picked up it's because it's about to be eaten. So, they would rather stay on the ground.

If you pick up a rabbit, make sure to support its feet under your arm so it isn't as afraid. But, keep a firm grip on it so it doesn't jump out of your arms from too high up. Rabbits have fragile bones, and can easily break their backs.
