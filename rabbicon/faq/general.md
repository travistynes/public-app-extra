## Rabbicon FAQ

### About

This FAQ is intended to provide useful tips and advice from personal experience having a rabbit as a pet. This information is applied to rabbits *in general*. This means it will not always be 100% true for every single rabbit. Keep this in mind.

On that note, we'll start with the first question I usually have when it comes to a new pet...

### Do rabbits bite?

No. That is the simple answer. Rabbits have teeth, so they *can* bite, and someone probably has been bitten by a rabbit at some point in time. But this is not something you should worry about or be afraid of. The reason rabbits don't bite is simple: Rabbits are prey animals. They don't use their teeth for defense, and they don't attack when they are frightened. They run away.

Kids pick up rabbits in pet stores all the time. The rabbits don't generally care, and rabbits don't really like to be picked up. I have held my rabbit against her will to give her medicine that she *really* didn't want to take. She was angry, but she never tried to bite.

If you want to be safe, make sure your rabbit has gotten to know you for awhile before you start doing things that would actually make it mad. If you've cornered it and it's scared, don't reach your hand towards it if it doesn't have a way out. Maybe then, the only thing it *could* do is try to bite. I've just never seen it happen myself.

### Do rabbits like to be picked up?

No. Some rabbits may put up with it, but even they would rather not be picked up. Most rabbits, even if they really like you, will kick and struggle to be put down. A rabbit's own mother doesn't pick it up. In nature, if a rabbit is being picked up it's because it's about to be eaten. So, they would rather stay on the ground.

If you pick up a rabbit, make sure to support its feet under your arm so it isn't as afraid. But, keep a firm grip on it so it doesn't jump out of your arms from too high up. Rabbits have fragile bones, and can easily break their backs.

### Are rabbits cuddly?

Not really. Think of their behavior as closer to a cat than a dog. They will come to you sometimes, when they feel like it. And they like to be petted sometimes, when they feel like it. But usually they're happy to lay around near where you are without getting up close and personal.

One piece of advice is that if you're trying to pick your rabbit up and cuddle with it, it will try to leave. But when you're minding your own business and ignoring the rabbit, they will never leave you alone. Whether you're eating, or trying to type on your laptop on the couch, they must know what you're doing and get under your feet, or jump on the couch for attention.

### What do rabbits like to do?

They like to lay around, sleep, eat, and poop. That's all they do. They will run around and play in very short bursts, but then it's time to go back to sleep.

### Is my rabbit male or female?

No one knows. Really. It's not possible to tell until they are mature, and then a vet will have to tell you. So until then, it's a big mystery.

### How long do rabbits live?

They live to be around 10 years old.

### Should I get my rabbit spayed / neutered?

Yes. Rabbits are mature enough to be spayed or neutered around 4 - 5 months old. You can also tell it's time if their behavior changes, they become more aggressive, or begin to mark their territory outside the litter box more frequently.

After the surgery, your rabbit's behavior should return to "normal".

### Can rabbits live alone, or should they be kept with other rabbits?

Rabbits are social and can live with other rabbits, but it is also common to keep a single rabbit as a pet. From what I can tell, they seem to do alright without other rabbits. As I've mentioned, their behavior is a lot like cats.

If you only have one rabbit, just make sure to give it daily attention, petting, and grooming so it doesn't get lonely. They will usually seek you out for attention, also. You will probably find that rabbits tend to like their space, and being alone is not a huge concern.
