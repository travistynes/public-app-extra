## Food

### What do rabbits eat?

Rabbits primarily eat hay. Young rabbits should eat Alfalfa hay as it has a higher protein content. They need this while they are growing. Mature rabbits should be switched to Timothy hay. I use a 50 lb. (compressed hay bale)[https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/standlee-premium-western-forage-premium-timothy-grab-go-compressed-bale]. It lasts forever, and is much cheaper than the bags of hay you can buy at a pet store.

I also give a handful of rabbit pellets once a day. These are high in protein, so they should not get very much of this. It's more of a treat.

### How often should I feed my rabbit?

Rabbits should have a constant supply of hay available. Rabbits can develop a condition called GI stasis if they go too long without eating, or if they have too little fiber (hay) in their diet. Their intestinal movement slows down and stops working. This will lead to death unless the rabbit is treated by a vet.

### Do rabbits need water?

Yes. A water bowl in the litter box is better than a watter bottle. It's easier for them to drink from, and it is also easier to refill. Rabbits should have a constant supply of water.

### What about treats?

Rabbits love treats, but never give too much. Too much can cause digestion problems.

Rabbits like:

* raisins
* apples
* bananas
* most vegetables

Just remember that rabbits are herbivores.
